# Advanced Workout App

## BUILD IN PUBLIC
## Work In Progress

## Overview

Welcome to the Advanced Workout App, a demonstration project showcasing the capabilities and large-scale architecture using SwiftUI. This project incorporates advanced features such as SwiftData for local data storage, Firebase for real-time data synchronization, and a comprehensive set of workout app functionalities.

## Features

### SwiftUI Interface

The user interface is built using SwiftUI, taking advantage of its modern and declarative approach to design elegant and efficient user experiences.

### SwiftData Integration

Local data storage is handled by SwiftData, ensuring seamless persistence of user data such as workout history, personal records, and preferences. SwiftData provides a robust and type-safe interface for managing the app's local database.

### Firebase Integration

Firebase is utilized for real-time data synchronization across devices. Users can seamlessly sync their workout data, achievements, and progress, making it accessible from any device.

### Workout Tracking

- Log and track various types of workouts, including strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises.
- Record sets, reps, and weights for strength exercises.
- Track duration, distance, and intensity for cardio exercises.

### Personalized Profiles

- Create and customize user profiles with personal information, fitness goals, and preferences.
- Set workout preferences, such as preferred workout duration, intensity levels, and preferred exercise types.

### Social Features

- Connect with friends and share workout achievements.
- Compete on leaderboards and challenge friends to achieve fitness goals.

### Progress Analytics

- View detailed analytics and insights into workout progress over time.
- Track personal records and celebrate milestones.

### Beautiful Charts and Visualizations

- Visual representation of workout history and progress through interactive charts.
- Monitor trends and identify areas for improvement.

## Architecture

The Advanced Workout App follows a Hexagonal architecture, separating concerns into different layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and entities.
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and interacts with the domain layer.
- **Interface Adapters**: Adapts the application to external frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, Firebase, SwiftData).
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: External tools and frameworks (SwiftData, Firebase) providing infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on your device or simulator.

## Requirements

- Xcode 13.0 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later
- iOS 14.0 or later
